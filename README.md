# Galleon
## A Collection of Fleet Bundles
Welcome! 👋

I created this repository to store all of my manifests I deploy to my [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) cluster using [Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/). Please copy my homework as you see fit for deploying to Kubernetes at home! ⚓️

## Setup
Simply create a GitRepo in Fleet called "galleon" pointed at this repo! 🎉

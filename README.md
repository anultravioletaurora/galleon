# Galleon
## A Collection of Fleet Bundles
Welcome! 👋

I created this repository to store all of my manifests I deploy to my [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) cluster using [Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/). Please copy my homework as you see fit for deploying to Kubernetes at home! ⚓️

## Setup
- Fork this repository
- Adjust it to your needs
- Create a GitRepo in Fleet called "galleon" pointed at your repo
- Create the dependent secrets for deployments
- Profit 🎉
